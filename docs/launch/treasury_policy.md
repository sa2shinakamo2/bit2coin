# Treasury Policy (Draft)

## Principles
- No private premine.
- Transparency: all treasury accounts and vesting are on-chain and visible in explorers.
- Narrow mandate: audits, security, infrastructure, grants/public goods.
- Privacy: founder disclosure is address-only; no personal identity is published by policy.

## Sources of funds
- Genesis allocation to public treasury: 7–8% (proposed), on-chain vesting.
- 100% of unclaimed snapshot allocations after a 12–18 month window → Founder vesting address (see "Founder vesting").
- Optional: 2% of staking rewards for the first 24 months; auto-sunset unless renewed via governance and published KPIs.

## Founder vesting
- Recipient: <FOUNDER_VESTING_ADDRESS> (multisig or vesting contract).
- Vesting: 4 years total, 12-month cliff, then linear monthly unlocks.
- Transparency: contract address and vesting schedule published in the snapshot announcement and genesis docs.
- Restrictions: founder tokens are non-transferable prior to vesting (enforced by vesting contract); no exemptions from slashing or governance rules.

## Core contributor vesting
- 2–3% of supply from treasury, 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, approved via on-chain governance, with public identities of recipients.

## Governance
- Multisig with named signers and rotation policy; quarterly transparency reports.
- On-chain proposals for significant disbursements; strict scope adherence.
