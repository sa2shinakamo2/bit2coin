# Snapshot Reproducibility Kit (outline)

This folder will contain scripts and instructions to reproduce the snapshot:
- Connect to `bitcoind` at the announced height H.
- Export address balances and build Merkle tree.
- Output: CSV/JSON of balances, Merkle root, and proofs for claim testing.

Deliverables will be finalized after the snapshot announcement and parameter freeze.
