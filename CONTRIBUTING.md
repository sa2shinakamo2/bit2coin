# Contributing to Bit2coin

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make focused changes with clear commit messages.
3. If touching scripts, run and lint them locally.
4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and rationale.

## Code style
- Python: keep it simple; add type hints when reasonable.

## Tests
- For scripts, provide example inputs and expected outputs when feasible.

## Security
- Never commit secrets or private keys. Files like `*.priv`, `*.pem`, `.wallet` are ignored by default.
- Report vulnerabilities via Security Advisories, not public issues (see `SECURITY.md`).

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the MIT License (`LICENSE`).
